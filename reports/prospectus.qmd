# Introduction

I am planning to build a framework that could help Chinese customers to distinguish real salmon fish from the fake trouts on Chinese market. This is a problem based on translation error that Chinese manufactures and dealers could legally lable their trouts as salmons, while eating raw trout has risk in parasite infection, and the price of fake salmon is way higher than regular trouts. This research aims at collect and analysis the products for sell, and find a pattern from their product names to see how they could be easily distinguished, and using the result to build a framework that could help customers in the future.

<!--

I understand from this that the research is focused translation errors. The notion is that the errors are caused by literalness from English to Chinese. Is this research grounded in a particular theory or framework? If so, it would be helpful to provide some context on that. Also, it would be helpful to provide some background on the significance of this research. Why is it important to study translation errors in English to Chinese translation? What are the potential implications of this research?

All of this should be connected to the relevant literature. What have other researchers said about this topic? What are the gaps in the literature that this research aims to address? This will lead to a more focused research question or hypothesis.

## Research hypothesis

My hypothesis on this issue is that by determining elements from the product names, such as fish type, place of production, brand name, and even price, we will be able to tell if the fish is salmon or not, and this method should work in a high possibility. The ones that claims to be Pacific salmon would more likely to be real salmon, and so do the ones from Norway. Brands that have higher reputation would be more credible, and products that has a price which does not fit the fish type would likely to be selling fake salmon.

<!--

This is a research question, more than a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a statement that can be tested. You will need to be more precise about what you mean by "Chinese translators" --are these new translators, translators with a certain level of experience, or all translators? You will also need to be more specific about what you mean by "reading too literally." You should have an idea of how to operationalize this concept so that when you analyze data you can identify instances of this behavior --ideally programmatically.

-->

## Research objectives

My objectives is to test if my hypothesis are correct, and conclude my finding into a framework that could be used for inspecting salmons sold in market. I want to find out if the elements I predicted can be used for distinguishing if a fish product is true or not. I wish I could come up with a list of keywords that customers can use to match with product information and distinguish the impostors among them.

<!--

Examples? Do you mean research articles? Or are you referring to anecdotal examples of translation errors? If anecdotal, this does not seem like it leads to a quantitative text analysis project.

Note that at this point, the research objectives point to the whether you will be using exploration, prediction, or inference and how the potential findings will be useful to contribute the the larger research question and area that you identify.

## Impact expection

I believe my research would help Chinese customers who wish to purchase salmon fish, especially for the ones who wish to make Japanese raw fish food. With the old trick of confusing customers go ineffective, maybe it would even push the regulation on dividing the two fish in terms of legislation.

<!--

So at least in part, the research is focused on providing a series of suggested practices to avoid translation errors of this type, right?

-->


## Literature review

I reviewed previous research articles both in China and USA. It turns out the translation error of salmon started from the confusion between chum salmon in America and Atlantic salmon from the sea. Chinese back in the late 1900s mistook chum salmon that is closer to trout with sea salmon that is more different. Chinese research also showed that China's geological environment is not suitable for fish farm salmon. They explained why Chinese would mistook trout at salmon in the very beginning, and why the manufactures who claim to be fish farming sea salmon are all lying about their products.


# Methods

## Data preparation

I will collect a random 100 products that showed up first by searching on Taobao, the Chinese version of Amazon. I will first distinguish whether these products are salmon or trout, then collected all the product information I need, including product name of the fish, place of production, brand name, and the pirce of the fish. The data set will be saved for analysis.

## Data analysis

I believe I will use exploratory methods for my research project. The project I am working focus on distinguishing the "salmon" products based on elements in their information. With nothing to predict, exploring would be more fitting for the research. The key variables would include product name, place of production, brand of the product, and price if possible. The analyzing of price on fish varies depending on season and other factors, so it might be removed in the final statement. The most reasonable research method would be visualizing the data collected, make a comparison between the frequency of variables shown in the information with the actual fish type of the product. This would directly lead to the conclusion of whether this new method for distinguishing would work or not.

# Expected results

I expect the result to be same with my hypothesis. Products that had "salmon (trout)" marked are not real salmon, and so does the ones that name as salmon without "Atlantic" added. Salmon that is produced in foreign countries such as Norway or Finland are real salmon, while the ones produced in China are trouts, while there should be a percentage of the trouts are produced in Norway as well. Brands with better reputation such as Supreme Salmon Mei Wei would be selling real salmon, while some unknown brands are selling trouts. The pricing however may not reflect the relationship between it and fish type correctly, considering the various aspects that will influence market price.

# Communication plan

A power point or poster would be most helpful for presenting the research result. Since the target audience will mostly be customers that are not specifically educated in both area of translation and marine biology, a more visualized final report will be more helpful. Try avoid using over professional terms when explaining the research background, but use the proper nouns for concepts and objects to make the presentation more convincing to the public.

# Conclusion

I wish my research result will be having the hypothesis proved so the listed elements could be made into a framework that customers can use as reference when purchasing salmon fish. I believe this outcome would help protect consumer rights and interests, prevent customers from parasite risk and save their money for the real products they are looking for. If enough peers of linguistic also reads the result, this long term translation error of salmon may eventually be fixed, and set an example for future translation in confusing terms or translations that is being influenced by so called conventional result that could be a mistake.

## Assessement 2

In this part of the research I find multiple articles from the past few decades, some directly provide research data for the research, and some provide examples that worth further research. What's most challenging for me right now are the Chinese scholar articles. They form an important part of my research, while they are being hard to be found online. Lots of the articles are not open to public, or do not have a full electronic version I could use. I would have to collect sometimes parts of existed documents on Chinese internet.

## Assessment 3

In this part of the research I have reviewed the data I collected. I divided them into two type, the ones that could be presented in charts to give a better picture of comparison, and the ones that are better analyzed and discussed. I review and re-considered if the data I collected do support my research purpose, and which different part would they be fit in. One of the examples was related to my previous interest during undergraduate study, and I might be even able to combine my previous study with my current research in the following progress.

## Assessment 4

In this part of the research I decided the analysis type I will be use and the specific method that would be applied. I find it most challenging that the examples used in the text book are quite different from the data I am working on, giving me a harder time to think about how the different variables and functions would work, and how would my chart be like after applied. On the other hand I also had my research aim improved, when thinking how the newly learned methods would work.

## Assessment 5

In the last part of the research I reviewed the analysis types and how I could present my research results to audience. I also reworked my previous steps such as the research objectives and data preparation based on previous studies and comments given by classmates and professor. If to make the research happen I would need to refine the data analysis part some more, but I believe that the general structure I have built should be a basic enough for starting a real research project.
