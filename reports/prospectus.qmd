# Introduction

My research is focused on the translation errors in term of faithfulness that is actually caused by literalness, appeared in English to Chinese translation made by Chinese translators.

## Research hypothesis

My hypothesis on this issue is that the Chinese translators are affected by their original language preference in reading too literally. Their understanding on the source text in English is being misguided by such reading behavior and therefore resulted in mistakes in their translations works.

## Research objectives

My objectives so far are looking into the three examples I found that were related to the topic. I will search into the history and origin of the language used in the examples, and find their connection between Chinese language preference and final result in their translations.

## Impact expection

I believe my research would help in the field of English to Chinese translation. Such problem in translation could be paid more attention to by translators and avodied, decrease the number of same problems in the future and bring up the overall translation quality.

(Assessement in the end)

## Literature review

This section summarizes previous research related to the topic and identifies gaps that the current study aims to address. It is important to provide a comprehensive review of the literature to demonstrate the significance of the research question and the potential contributions of the study. The literature review should conclude with a clear statement of the research question or hypothesis that the study aims to address.

# Methods

This section describes the data preparation and analysis methods that will be used to address the research question or hypothesis. It should include a detailed description of the data acquisition, data organization, and data enrichment process, as well as the feature selection and engineering, analysis techniques, and evaluation process.

## Data preparation

The data needed for this research would be the examples for both the language preference itself and the translation error that is related to such language preference. The first sets of data will be used to support the argue that Chinese people have this language preference of guessing the meaning of texts in its literal form, and the second sets of data will be examples of translation errors that occurred based on it.

1. There are plenty of examples of taking the text too literally in Chinese language itself. I need only to translate them into English for the reference of research audience.

2. I have chosen 3 examples as the second sets of data. Two of them are cases of translation errors that were once reported on news, and one of them is based on the comparsion between Chinese and Japanese characters. The examples would be analysied, including the background research that would support arguments concluded.

3. For first sets of data, and the third example provided in the second sets of data, there could be charts made to make an easier comparison between the correct meaning of words with the incorrect ones made due to literal reading.

4. For the first two examples used in the second sets of data, analyzing and discussion would be sufficient.

## Data analysis

This section describes the feature selection and engineering, analysis techniques, and evaluation process that will be used to address the research question or hypothesis. It should include a detailed description of the features that will be used in the analysis, the specific analysis techniques that will be applied, and the process of evaluating the results.

# Expected results

This section presents the hypothesized findings based on the research question and analysis methods. It should include a clear statement of the expected results and their potential implications for the field of Linguistics and language science.

# Communication plan

This section describes the plan for reporting, presenting, and sharing the results of the study. It should include a detailed description of the intended audience for the study, the format of the final report, and any plans for sharing the results with the broader community.

# Conclusion

This section provides a summary of the research proposal and its potential impact on the field of Linguistics and language science. It should include a clear statement of the significance of the research question and the potential contributions of the study.

# References

This section includes a list of sources cited in the prospectus. It should be formatted according to the citation style used in the field of Linguistics and language science.

# Appendix {.appendix}

This section includes any additional information that is relevant to the prospectus, such as data sources, code, or other supplementary materials.

## Assessement 2

In this part of the research I find multiple articles from the past few decades, some directly provide research data for the research, and some provide examples that worth further research. What's most challenging for me right now are the Chinese scholar articles. They form an important part of my research, while they are being hard to be found online. Lots of the articles are not open to public, or do not have a full electronic version I could use. I would have to collect sometimes parts of existed documents on Chinese internet.

## Assessment 3

In this part of the research I have reviewed the data I collected. I divided them into two type, the ones that could be presented in charts to give a better picture of comparison, and the ones that are better analyzed and discussed. I review and re-considered if the data I collected do support my research purpose, and which different part would they be fit in. One of the examples was related to my previous interest during undergraduate study, and I might be even able to combine my previous study with my current research in the following progress.
