The first sets of data will be used to support the argue that Chinese people have this language preference of guessing the meaning of texts in its literal form, and the second sets of data will be examples of translation errors that occurred based on it.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of taking the text too literally in Chinese language itself. I need only to translate them into English for the reference of research audience.\nI have chosen 3 examples as the second sets of data. Two of them are cases of translation errors that were once reported on news, and one of them is based on the comparsion between Chinese and Japanese characters. The examples would be analysied, including the background research that would support arguments concluded.\nFor first sets of data, and the third example provided in the second sets of data, there could be charts made to make an easier comparison between the correct meaning of words with the incorrect ones made due to literal reading.\nFor the first two examples used in the second sets of data, analyzing and discussion would be sufficient.",

The project I am working focus on distinguishing the “salmon” products based on elements in their information. With nothing to predict, exploring would be more fitting for the research. The key variables would include product name, place of production, brand of the product, and price if possible. The analyzing of price on fish varies depending on season and other factors, so it might be removed in the final statement. The most reasonable research method would be visualizing the data collected, make a comparison between the frequency of variables shown in the information with the actual fish type of the product. This would directly lead to the conclusion of whether this new method for distinguishing would work or not.",
