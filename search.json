    "text": "I am planning to build a framework that could help Chinese customers to distinguish real salmon fish from the fake trouts on Chinese market. This is a problem based on translation error that Chinese manufactures and dealers could legally lable their trouts as salmons, while eating raw trout has risk in parasite infection, and the price of fake salmon is way higher than regular trouts. This research aims at collect and analysis the products for sell, and find a pattern from their product names to see how they could be easily distinguished, and using the result to build a framework that could help customers in the future.\n\n\nMy hypothesis on this issue is that by determining elements from the product names, such as fish type, place of production, brand name, and even price, we will be able to tell if the fish is salmon or not, and this method should work in a high possibility. The ones that claims to be Pacific salmon would more likely to be real salmon, and so do the ones from Norway. Brands that have higher reputation would be more credible, and products that has a price which does not fit the fish type would likely to be selling fake salmon.\n\n\n\nMy objectives is to test if my hypothesis are correct, and conclude my finding into a framework that could be used for inspecting salmons sold in market. I want to find out if the elements I predicted can be used for distinguishing if a fish product is true or not. I wish I could come up with a list of keywords that customers can use to match with product information and distinguish the impostors among them.\n\n\n\nI believe my research would help Chinese customers who wish to purchase salmon fish, especially for the ones who wish to make Japanese raw fish food. With the old trick of confusing customers go ineffective, maybe it would even push the regulation on dividing the two fish in terms of legislation.\n\n\n\nI reviewed previous research articles both in China and USA. It turns out the translation error of salmon started from the confusion between chum salmon in America and Atlantic salmon from the sea. Chinese back in the late 1900s mistook chum salmon that is closer to trout with sea salmon that is more different. Chinese research also showed that China’s geological environment is not suitable for fish farm salmon. They explained why Chinese would mistook trout at salmon in the very beginning, and why the manufactures who claim to be fish farming sea salmon are all lying about their products.",

The project I am working focus on distinguishing the “salmon” products based on elements in their information. With nothing to predict, exploring would be more fitting for the research. The key variables would include product name, place of production, brand of the product, and price if possible. The analyzing of price on fish varies depending on season and other factors, so it might be removed in the final statement. The most reasonable research method would be visualizing the data collected, make a comparison between the frequency of variables shown in the information with the actual fish type of the product. This would directly lead to the conclusion of whether this new method for distinguishing would work or not.",
